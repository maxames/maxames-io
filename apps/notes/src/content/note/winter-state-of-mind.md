The “Big Dark” is reaching its peak in Seattle with the impending winter solstice only a few weeks away. What I love most about this time of year is the abundance of opportunity and time for introspection, for being present with things exactly as they are. I’m not certain whether the world around me slows or what I’m perceiving as external is merely a mirror reflecting my own mind.
