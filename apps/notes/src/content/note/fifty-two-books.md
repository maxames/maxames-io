For years I’ve aimed for 52 books and never hit it. *My* new year started on Dec 1, and six days in I just finished book three: Bukowski's *Post Office*. I’m adding his work to a project where I read all of an author’s novels in the order they were published; so far I’ve completed Camus, Steinbeck, Orwell, and Rand. 2025-26 might just be my year.
