Rumi wrote about letting yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love. I’ve been thinking about what the stronger pull is for me, and I think it comes from what I’ve received most generously from others: forgiveness when I’ve failed, empathy when I’ve struggled, care when I needed it. That abundance shapes what I want to give back. My hope for the new year is to let that pull guide me.
