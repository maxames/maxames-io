I sympathize with Gen Z’s exhausted disengagement (aka the stare). It’s unsurprising, even understandable, to withdraw emotionally in a labor market that failed them and paywalled opportunity behind debt. I wonder what it’d feel like if kindness weren’t a job requirement but something we desired to authentically offer from real connection.
