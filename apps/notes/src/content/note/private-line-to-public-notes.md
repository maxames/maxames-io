I set up a workflow on my Zo Computer today so I can send it text messages from my phone and have them land here as notes. This is the first time I’ve had a public space to share short-form, off-the-cuff thoughts since I deleted social media years ago. The audience is tiny compared to my long-gone feeds (is there anybody out there?), but it still feels like a connective experience.
